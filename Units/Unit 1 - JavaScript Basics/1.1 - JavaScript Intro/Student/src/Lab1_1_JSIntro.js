// TODO 1: Print your full name with console.log()
console.log("Andres Perez");


// TODO 2: Declare variable favoriteFood, assign "Steak", then reassign "Pizza"
console.log("favoriteFood")
var favoriteFood = "Steak";
favoriteFood = "Pizza";


// TODO 3: Create variable mystery, assign a string, then a number, print type each time
var mystery = "Hello";
console.log(mystery);
console.log(typeof mystery); 
mystery = 42;
console.log(typeof mystery); 



// TODO 4: Declare const schoolName, try to reassign
const schoolName = "Columbus";
console.log(schoolName)
//const schoolName = "Belen";       DOES NOT WORK CAUSE ERROR



// TODO 5: Create three valid camelCase variables and print them

var lastName = "Perez";
console.log(lastName);
var birthYear = "2010";
